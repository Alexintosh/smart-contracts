# Flexa Smart Contracts

## Install

```bash
yarn
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

But you should be using use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

## Testing

Ensure `ganache-cli` is running. You only need to do this once.

```bash
yarn run ganache
```

Run all tests in the `/test` dir.

```bash
yarn run test
```

**NOTE:** Tests use javascript's `async/await` syntax, so you will need Node >= 7 to run them.
